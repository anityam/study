# K9
This is a tool that can be used to manage the kubernetes cluster. The location for more info on the tool itself is located at [github/k9](https://github.com/derailed/k9s).

## Installation
```brew install derailed/k9s/k9s```

## Experience
The tool is really useful to view a lot of items at once in your cluster. It creates a new terminal based app where you will be able to view all the container based on namespace. Kill or log into pods based on your access level in the cluster and also will be able to get logs. This is helpful when doing an overall inspection of the cluster level and looking at logs. This can be used to tail logs and save the logs locally too.
